JSInterpreter
===========

My JavaScript Interpreter is written all by hand.
Surely I read some sources that written by others.
I have learned many ideas and used them in my code.
It is not completed.Many Bugs still can be found in this program.

Now it supports only the core features in JavaScript.

### The features it supports as fellows:

* Basic Arithmetic
* Function Declaration,Function Call
* var declaration and assignment;if else;return;while;
* Annoymous function.
* Bool expression

In the future,it will support some library functions and arrays. 

## Usage:
When you input a statement,please press more Enter-Key after that.

### Some cases for you to test my interpreter:

* function add(a){a=a+1;return a;}

* var testB=function(){return 10;};

* var b=1;

* var c=b;

* var c=add(1);

* var obj=new Object();

* b;

* 1;

* 1+2;

* 100+100;
